When inspecting the plain text within the .Rproj file itself (something like vim name.Rproj), there isn’t any magic happening under the hood in connection to Quarto. However, each of these options correspond to different commands that you could also run via the cli. Remember, Quarto is a tool that is built on top of and extends Pandoc, which also is a cli, so don’t be afraid to run things that way too. Initially I thought that if I decided to do a Quarto Website instead of a Quarto Blog I’d be locked into something and that is not the case at all! So don’t worry too much at this stage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the source (code)\n\n\n\nIf you want to examine Quarto’s source code on GitHub, it’s under quarto-cli. If you want to see the source code for the Quarto website itself, it’s under quarto-web. So if there’s something you see on the main website that you like, check the GitHub repo to see how they’re doing it."

    "section": "<div>s and <span>s",
    "text": "&lt;div&gt;s and &lt;span&gt;s\n\nFirst, let’s talk about what’s going on here. If you’re new to this syntax of ::: {.some-class} ::: then take a bit of time to read the Quarto docs on divs and spans to gain a good foundation. In Pandoc these are called fenced divs.\nOnce you understand the syntax, it might not be apparent at first, but these fenced divs are extraordinarily flexible! Let’s break down the above code chunk:\nThe ::: {.content-block}::: is a &lt;div&gt; defining the padding for the top and bottom and the margin for the left and the right; here is the CSS from index.css:\n.content-block {\n  padding-top: 20px;\n  padding-bottom: 10px;\n  margin-left: 30px;\n  margin-right: 30px;\n}\nThis creates space on the page for the two main components:\n\n\n\n\nThe container\n\n\n::: {.features} :::\nSimilarly to the .content-block, this is like a row for the other content elements. On the Bootstrap 5 [page] you’ll see lots of examples of something like container -&gt; row -&gt; col.\n\n\n\n\nThe flexbox\n\n\n::: {.feature} :::\nThese are the individual elements of content. They’re like post-its with info on them. Each .feature is contained within the .features container.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPutting it together\n\n\n\nYou can think of the .container like a board you want to hang on the wall–the .features is like a sticky adhesive and the .feature the squares with notes on them that you stick to your board.\n\n\n\nFrom the docs, Bootstrap 5 uses a mobile-first flexbox grid to build layouts of all shapes and sizes thanks to a twelve column system, six default responsive tiers, Sass variables and mixins, and dozens of predefined classes. It can definitely be confusing if you haven’t ever written HTML before, so don’t worry if it isn’t clicking right away. Learning more about Bootstrap 5 will only enhance your Quarto experience if you’re interested. The better you understand the grid the more flexible you will be when thinking of how you want to arrange components on your site and what is available to you as ways to do that."

Well, it’s saying, whatever 100% of the height is for this normally, add an additional 250 pixels. Why we want to do this will become apparent with the next two classes:\n\n\n\n\n.feature-top\n\n\n.feature-top {\n  height: 75%;\n}\nWe want this &lt;div&gt; to take up 75% of .features’s height.\n\n\n\n\n.feature-bottom\n\n\n.feature-bottom {\n  height: 25%;\n}\nWe want this &lt;div&gt; to take up 25% of .features’s height\n\n\n\n\nThe goal is to have the .feature divisible by two but in a way that allows for the bottom portion to align across .features rather than have the button in different positions based on the length of the document being highlighted by the document listing.\nNow, this may not be the best solution–I imagine that for someone that is an experienced front-end dev or someone that knows Lua could potentially do something much more elegant. This seemed to me to be the best way to accomplish this for myself. I see the buttons align and that makes me happy"

I’ll try to share what limited clarity I’ve been able to obtain but if this isn’t something you’ll want to do you can feel free to skip.\nI followed the example from quarto-web and created an ejs directory and then put my custom listing .ejs file in that directory. Before threading everything together, let’s just look at how the custom listing is working:\n&lt;!-- attributes for item --&gt;\n&lt;!--  freeze,\n      title-block-banner,\n      title,\n      author,\n      date,\n      categories,\n      image,\n      path,\n      image-alt,\n      description,\n      filename,\n      file-modified,\n      reading-time,\n      sortableValues --&gt;\n&lt;% for (const item of items.slice(0, 1)) { %&gt;\n  &lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=\"&lt;%- item.path %&gt;\"&gt;&lt;%= item.title %&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n  &lt;small&gt;{{&lt; fa calendar &gt;}} &lt;%= item.date %&gt;&lt;/small&gt;\n&lt;% } %&gt; \nFirst, please excuse the low quality but high effort JavaScript. Second, notice the comment I added for the attributes available to us through the initial for loop. I wanted to keep these readily available in the event I need to create some other custom listing. Based on what it is you want to highlight you can change or alter this to see if it works for your purposes as well. What I wanted was just the most recent listing from a document list, so I only want one listing. That is the purpose of the .slice(0, 1) method. The goal is to not have to update the index.qmd ever–even when there are new blog posts, talks, or projects. I’m slicing this list for the very first (most recent) listing and just grabbing a minimal amount of attributes: its location, the title, and the date."

By setting sort: \"date desc\" in conjunction with the .slice method in the EJS template, that is how we’re able to get the most recent piece of content from these three categories.\nThen it’s as simple as adding the ID you specified in the YAML in a &lt;div&gt;, e.g.:\n::: {#listing-blog}\n:::\nIt took me a little bit of time to get a feel for how this all comes together so I’d recommend playing around with this a bit to build an intuition."

    "text": "Discussion\nWhen analyzing IMDB ratings of “Trailer Park Boys” some interesting trends were observed. The downward trend beginning around season four makes sense to any fan of the show as that is when the show got a bigger budget and got away from its low-budget, digital camera, homemade look. This all culminates to season ten, known by fans as the “Snoop Dogg season”, which is regarded as the worst season but has likely the largest budget. It was surprising to see season five as an outlier from the general trend, rated considerably lower. I suspect this is due to the slightly darker theme of the season and the more cohesive plot."

    "text": "Discussion\nWhen analyzing IMDB ratings of “Trailer Park Boys” some interesting trends were observed. The downward trend beginning around season four makes sense to any fan of the show as that is when the show got a bigger budget and got away from its low-budget, digital camera, homemade look. This all culminates to season ten, known by fans as the “Snoop Dogg season”, which is regarded as the worst season but has likely the largest budget. It was surprising to see season five as an outlier from the general trend, rated considerably lower. I suspect this is due to the slightly darker theme of the season and the more cohesive plot."

    "text": "Analysis\n1a)\nThe distribution of Episode ratings in “Trailer Park Boys” appears to be normal as can be seen in Fig. 1. People tend to rate the episodes fairly high and the majority of the reviews are withing .6 of each other on the 10 point rating scale.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMin.\n1st Qu.\nMedian\nMean\n3rd Qu.\nMax.\n\n\n\n\n7.1\n7.9\n8.2\n8.217\n8.6\n9.2\n\n\n\n\n\n1b)\nThe distribution of user votes appears to be right skewed as can be seen in Fig. 2. The median number of votes an episode gets is 360 while some episodes get more than double that number.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMin.\n1st Qu.\nMedian\nMean\n3rd Qu.\nMax.\n\n\n\n\n178\n232\n360.5\n373.5\n489.8\n861\n\n\n\n\n\n2a)\nLooking at episode ratings by season in Fig. 3 some trends can be observed. The show started off with its first four seasons doing consistently well with means around an average rating of 8.5. Then following a poor rated season five, a downtrend began, bottoming out at season ten with an average rating of around 7.5. The next and final two seasons were rated slightly higher with the final season rating right around the overall show mean of 8.2.\n\n\n\n\n\n2b)\nA clear trend can be seen when looking at number of votes an episode got as a predictor of the rating of that episode as seen in Fig. 4. For every one vote increase in the number of votes a 0.001561 increase in episode rating was estimated. This positive trend becomes a little less clear with the very high number of votes, as there is an outlive that received 861 votes and had one of the four worst episode ratings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nEstimate\nStd.
