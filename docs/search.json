    "text": "I spent a decent amount of time working on rebuilding my site with Quarto but the decision of should I rebuild my website was pretty impulsive. It’s not the first time I’ve hastily moved to a shiny new static site generator. Before that I was using Pelican and before that, Jykell; I suppose I love the process of trying to design something new and see how I can take advantage of something new to make it even easier to blog!\nI was going to make a joke about Field of Dreams and how I built it and the blog posts didn’t come. But that’s not the important part! The important part was that I went in the world wide web version of the yard to do my little project.\n\nWhat this post will not be is a complete end-to-end guide on building a website with Quarto. I think there are already a lot of great pieces of content and the docs are really well put together. I don’t want to just rehash what already exists. I thought it might be helpful to just document how I went about taking some things from the Quarto website and editing/altering for myself and really just focus on some of the aspects of using Quarto that were not initially clear and required some patience to work through.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJust keep in mind\n\n\n\nI’m by no means a front-end professional and a lot of what I’ve discovered putting this site together was from reading the docs, looking for examples, and trying things out. If you notice something that isn’t right; feel free to create an issue on the repo. Thanks!"

    "text": "Quarto, how to start?\n\nSo we have four different options above. When inspecting the plain text within the .Rproj file itself (something like vim name.Rproj), there isn’t any magic happening under the hood in connection to Quarto. However, each of these options correspond to different commands that you could also run via the cli. Remember, Quarto is a tool that is built on top of and extends Pandoc, which also is a cli, so don’t be afraid to run things that way too. Initially I thought that if I decided to do a Quarto Website instead of a Quarto Blog I’d be locked into something and that is not the case at all! So don’t worry too much at this stage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the source (code)\n\n\n\nIf you want to examine Quarto’s source code on GitHub, it’s under quarto-cli. If you want to see the source code for the Quarto website itself, it’s under quarto-web. So if there’s something you see on the main website that you like, check the GitHub repo to see how they’re doing it."

    "text": "&lt;div&gt;s and &lt;span&gt;s\n\nFirst, let’s talk about what’s going on here. If you’re new to this syntax of ::: {.some-class} ::: then take a bit of time to read the Quarto docs on divs and spans to gain a good foundation. In Pandoc these are called fenced divs.\nOnce you understand the syntax, it might not be apparent at first, but these fenced divs are extraordinarily flexible! Let’s break down the above code chunk:\nThe ::: {.content-block}::: is a &lt;div&gt; defining the padding for the top and bottom and the margin for the left and the right; here is the CSS from index.css:\n.content-block {\n  padding-top: 20px;\n  padding-bottom: 10px;\n  margin-left: 30px;\n  margin-right: 30px;\n}\nThis creates space on the page for the two main components:\n\n\n\n\nThe container\n\n\n::: {.features} :::\nSimilarly to the .content-block, this is like a row for the other content elements. On the Bootstrap 5 [page] you’ll see lots of examples of something like container -&gt; row -&gt; col.\n\n\n\n\nThe flexbox\n\n\n::: {.feature} :::\nThese are the individual elements of content. They’re like post-its with info on them. Each .feature is contained within the .features container.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPutting it together\n\n\n\nYou can think of the .container like a board you want to hang on the wall–the .features is like a sticky adhesive and the .feature the squares with notes on them that you stick to your board.\n\n\n\nFrom the docs, Bootstrap 5 uses a mobile-first flexbox grid to build layouts of all shapes and sizes thanks to a twelve column system, six default responsive tiers, Sass variables and mixins, and dozens of predefined classes. It can definitely be confusing if you haven’t ever written HTML before, so don’t worry if it isn’t clicking right away. Learning more about Bootstrap 5 will only enhance your Quarto experience if you’re interested. The better you understand the grid the more flexible you will be when thinking of how you want to arrange components on your site and what is available to you as ways to do that."

Well, it’s saying, whatever 100% of the height is for this normally, add an additional 250 pixels. Why we want to do this will become apparent with the next two classes:\n\n\n\n\n.feature-top\n\n\n.feature-top {\n  height: 75%;\n}\nWe want this &lt;div&gt; to take up 75% of .features’s height.\n\n\n\n\n.feature-bottom\n\n\n.feature-bottom {\n  height: 25%;\n}\nWe want this &lt;div&gt; to take up 25% of .features’s height\n\n\n\n\nThe goal is to have the .feature divisible by two but in a way that allows for the bottom portion to align across .features rather than have the button in different positions based on the length of the document being highlighted by the document listing.\nNow, this may not be the best solution–I imagine that for someone that is an experienced front-end dev or someone that knows Lua could potentially do something much more elegant. This seemed to me to be the best way to accomplish this for myself. I see the buttons align and that makes me happy"

I’ll try to share what limited clarity I’ve been able to obtain but if this isn’t something you’ll want to do you can feel free to skip.\nI followed the example from quarto-web and created an ejs directory and then put my custom listing .ejs file in that directory. Before threading everything together, let’s just look at how the custom listing is working:\n&lt;!-- attributes for item --&gt;\n&lt;!--  freeze,\n      title-block-banner,\n      title,\n      author,\n      date,\n      categories,\n      image,\n      path,\n      image-alt,\n      description,\n      filename,\n      file-modified,\n      reading-time,\n      sortableValues --&gt;\n&lt;% for (const item of items.slice(0, 1)) { %&gt;\n  &lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=\"&lt;%- item.path %&gt;\"&gt;&lt;%= item.title %&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n  &lt;small&gt;{{&lt; fa calendar &gt;}} &lt;%= item.date %&gt;&lt;/small&gt;\n&lt;% } %&gt; \nFirst, please excuse the low quality but high effort JavaScript. Second, notice the comment I added for the attributes available to us through the initial for loop. I wanted to keep these readily available in the event I need to create some other custom listing. Based on what it is you want to highlight you can change or alter this to see if it works for your purposes as well. What I wanted was just the most recent listing from a document list, so I only want one listing. That is the purpose of the .slice(0, 1) method. The goal is to not have to update the index.qmd ever–even when there are new blog posts, talks, or projects. I’m slicing this list for the very first (most recent) listing and just grabbing a minimal amount of attributes: its location, the title, and the date."

    "text": "Connecting it all together\n\nTo connect the custom listing you’ll need to add it in your .qmd file’s YAML header. Here’s an example from my index.qmd:\n---\ntitle: \"\"\npage-layout: full\ntitle-block-banner: true\nlisting: \n  - id: listing-blog\n    contents: \"blog/\"\n    template: /ejs/most-recent-only.ejs\n    sort: \"date desc\"\n  - id: listing-talks\n    contents: \"talks/\"\n    template: /ejs/most-recent-only.ejs\n    sort: \"date desc\"\n  - id: listing-projects\n    contents: \"projects/\"\n    template: /ejs/most-recent-only.ejs\n    sort: \"date desc\"\n---\nWhat this is saying is that Quarto will create an ID that can be used to know where on the page to have this listing display its listing and how to sort the listing. By setting sort: \"date desc\" in conjunction with the .slice method in the EJS template, that is how we’re able to get the most recent piece of content from these three categories.\nThen it’s as simple as adding the ID you specified in the YAML in a &lt;div&gt;, e.g.:\n::: {#listing-blog}\n:::\nIt took me a little bit of time to get a feel for how this all comes together so I’d recommend playing around with this a bit to build an intuition."

The show started off with its first four seasons doing consistently well with means around an average rating of 8.5. Then following a poor rated season five, a downtrend began, bottoming out at season ten with an average rating of around 7.5. The next and final two seasons were rated slightly higher with the final season rating right around the overall show mean of 8.2.\n\n\n\n\n\n2b)\nA clear trend can be seen when looking at number of votes an episode got as a predictor of the rating of that episode as seen in Fig. 4. For every one vote increase in the number of votes a 0.001561 increase in episode rating was estimated. This positive trend becomes a little less clear with the very high number of votes, as there is an outlive that received 861 votes and had one of the four worst episode ratings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nEstimate\nStd.

    "text": "Discussion\nWhen analyzing IMDB ratings of “Trailer Park Boys” some interesting trends were observed. The downward trend beginning around season four makes sense to any fan of the show as that is when the show got a bigger budget and got away from its low-budget, digital camera, homemade look. This all culminates to season ten, known by fans as the “Snoop Dogg season”, which is regarded as the worst season but has likely the largest budget. It was surprising to see season five as an outlier from the general trend, rated considerably lower. I suspect this is due to the slightly darker theme of the season and the more cohesive plot."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nThe following analysis compares two TV shows, “How I Met Your Mother” and “Friends”. The data for this project is from IMDB and the variables of interest are the episode number, the season number, the average rating of each episode, and the number of ratings votes each episode got. “How I Met Your Mother” was a sitcom on CBS that aired for 9 seasons totaling 208 episodes from 2005-2014, over that span the average episode rating was 8.03. “Friends” was a sitcom that aired on NBC for 10 seasons from 1994-2004. Over that time it aired 235 episodes with an average IMDB episode rating of 8.33. These two sitcoms have many similarities primarily that they are both about adults in their 20’s living in New York City.\n\n\nAnalysis\nFigure one shows the average episode rating by season, “Friends” shows fairly steady ratings by season with season 5 and 10 (the final season) being the highest just under a rating of 8.5. “How I Met Your Mother” shows a consistent decline in ratings, with season 9 (the final season) having the lowest average rating. An interesting observation about season 9 is that it contains both the highest rated episode and the lowest rated episode, this will be investigated more later.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure two compares the number of ratings votes each episode got grouped by season and analyzed using side-by-side box plots. It can be seen that the average number of votes per episode decline by season, however both see an uptick in the final season and both have one large outlier in that final season.\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal season\nBelow in figure 3 an analysis of number of votes by episode in the final season can be seen. The number of votes by episode for “Friends” in the final season is consistent with the average number of votes over the course of the series, up until the final episode which received 14633 votes and is the second highest rated episode ever with a rating of 9.6. The number of votes for “How I Met Your Mother” contain a few more points that stray for the rest of the data, episode 16 received 9,749 votes and is the shows highest rated episode with a rating of 9.5. The final two episodes received 9,894 and 18,527 votes respectively with the final episode of the show receiving a rating of 5.5 and taking the crown for worst rated episode.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following figure shows the number of votes the final episode of “How I Met Your Mother” received was an outlier nearly four standard deviations from the expected value.\n\n\n3.965\n\n\nThe following figure shows the number of votes the final episode of “Friends” received was an outlier greater than three standard deviations from the expected value.\n\n\n3.843\n\n\nFigure 4 shows the average rating of each episode in the final season of both “How I Met Your Mother” and “Friends”. “Friends” has similar ratings of episodes in the final season around the 8.5 mark. The final episode of “Friends” has the highest rating in the season. While “How I Met Your Mother” has quite the spread of values, including the final episode which has the lowest rating of the season.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion\nWhile similar in setting, genre, and plot the trends in average episode ratings of “How I Met Your Mother” and “Friends” differ quite a bit. “Friends” has consistently high episode ratings by season ultimately resulting in a high rated final season and a final episode that received the second highest overall rating. While “How I Met Your Mother” had steadily decreasing average episode ratings by season, finishing with a worst rated final season and a worst rated final episode. Both shows had final episodes that received an extremely high number of votes 3.843 standard deviations from the expected value from the final season for “Friends” and 3.965 for “How I Met Your Mother”, however those for “Friends” were mostly high ratings and those for “How I Met Your Mother” were mostly dismal.\n\n\nReferences\nhttps://www.imdb.com/title/tt0460649/?ref_=tt_ov_inf https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108778/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0"

    "text": "Look at box office, ratings, votes, etc. and compare with google trends for oscars search\n\nIntroduction\nOver the last 30 years it seems that the movie that wins best picture at the Oscars has gotten more “artsy” and less “popular”. To investigate this question I will be using data pulled from the IMDB website, specifically the variables that count the number of ratings votes, the average rating, and the run time of movies for best picture winning movies over the last 30 years.\nIt is important to note that the last two best picture winners, “CODA” and “Nomadland” were not included in the data set as well as the 1996 film “The English Patient”\n\n\nAnalysis\nFigure 1 below shows a consistent decline in the number of votes the best picture received on IMDB by year. For each one year increase, the number of votes received by the best picture winner decreases by an estimated 21826 (p-value 0.027). This shows a steady decline in the popularity of the best picture winning movie.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nEstimate\nStd.

To analyze this I looked at IMDB data of the Oscar winners of the last 30 years and made multiple plots to visualize trends looking at number of votes and average rating. The results from the graphs of number of votes and average ratings showed a decline in both the number of people seeing the Oscar nominated movie over recent years and how much they liked the movie. Hopefully the Academy can change its ways and award films more popular among everyday people the best picture award and we can get more films like “Forrest Gump”.\n\n\nReferences\nhttps://www.imdb.com/search/title/?count=100&groups=oscar_best_picture_winners&sort=year%2Cdesc"

    "title": "Exploring Greek Life Trends: A Stat 113 Survey Analysis",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nFor this project I used the Stat 113 data set which contains survey data from Stat 113 students. The variables of interest are weather or not a student is in or planning on joing Greek life, the students school year, the students gender, and a new variable I created that evaluates weather the semester was pre or postpandemic.\nIn my first semester back (last spring) since the Covid-19 pandemic I noticed that it was hard to meet new people and have a social scene. It also felt like most of my grade joined greek life. To investigate this I looked at the general trend of greek life participation and if there were more males rushing fraternaties postpandemic.\n\n\nData Exploration\nFirst I looked at the trends in males and females who were either in, or planning on joining greek life. A steady increase in the percent of males in, or planning on joining greek life can be seen. In fact, these most recent two semesters are the first time a higher percent of males than females in Stat 113 or in or planning on joining greek life.\n\n\n`geom_smooth()` using method = 'loess' and formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstat113FSmale &lt;-\nstat113P2 %&gt;% drop_na(Greek) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Year=as_factor(Year))%&gt;%\n  filter(Gender== \"M\",\n         Year == 1 | Year == 2) %&gt;%\n   group_by(Term, Greek, Year) %&gt;%\n  summarise(ncount = n()) %&gt;%\n  ungroup() %&gt;%\n  group_by(Term, Year) %&gt;%\n  mutate(total = sum(ncount)) %&gt;% \n  ungroup() %&gt;%\n  mutate(propGreek = (ncount/total)*100) %&gt;%\n  filter(Greek == \"Planning\") %&gt;%\n    mutate(Year = factor(Year, levels = c(\"1\", \"2\"), \n              labels = c(\"Freshman\", \"Sophmore\")))\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'Term', 'Greek'. You can override using the\n`.groups` argument.\n\n\nNext I looked to see where all those males were coming from. Both freshman and sophmores males have been increasing in perctage planning on joining greek life, however, in the past few semesters there has been a jump in sophmore males; especially that last spring semester I spoke about in my introduction.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo investigate Sophmore males planning on joining greek further I ploted them individually with standard error bars and colored by weather it was pre or post pandemic. Last spring was by far the highest percentage of Sophmore males planning on joining greek, my hypothesis for this is that there was a need to affiliate for social reasons in that pandemic semester, and many of the people that would’ve rushed in the fall were not on campus. My hypothesis for why fall of 202 was so low is that people had been away from campus for so long that they felt like they needed to get their barrings and didnt know hat to expect socially.\n\n\n\n\n\nFinnally I compared the proportion of male sophmores planning to join a Fraternity in the semesters leading up with the proportion post pandemic and found that there was a difference in means at the 0.05938 signifcance level.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo Sample t-test: propGreek by postPandemic (continued below)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest statistic\ndf\nP value\nAlternative hypothesis\n\n\n\n\n1.983\n23\n0.05938\ntwo.sided\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmean in group Postpandemic\nmean in group Pretpandemic\n\n\n\n\n20.07\n11.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWrap-up\nIn conclusion, there has been a consistant increase in the percentage of males planning or in greek life, in fact these past two semesters were the first time that percentage was higher than the percentage of females. The second semester post pandemic saw a large uptick in the number of sophmore males planning on joing greek, I hypothesize this is because the limited social life on campus created pressure to socially affiliate. For sophmore males there was an increase in planning on joing greek at the 0.059 signifcance level. In the future I hope to revisit this data to see if this was just a blip."

    "title": "Exploring Greek Life Trends: A Stat 113 Survey Analysis",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nFor this project I used the Stat 113 data set which contains survey data from Stat 113 students. The variables of interest are weather or not a student is in or planning on joing Greek life, the students school year, the students gender, and a new variable I created that evaluates weather the semester was pre or postpandemic.\nIn my first semester back (last spring) since the Covid-19 pandemic I noticed that it was hard to meet new people and have a social scene. It also felt like most of my grade joined greek life. To investigate this I looked at the general trend of greek life participation and if there were more males rushing fraternaties postpandemic.\n\n\nData Exploration\nFirst I looked at the trends in males and females who were either in, or planning on joining greek life. A steady increase in the percent of males in, or planning on joining greek life can be seen. In fact, these most recent two semesters are the first time a higher percent of males than females in Stat 113 or in or planning on joining greek life.\n\n\n`geom_smooth()` using method = 'loess' and formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstat113FSmale &lt;-\nstat113P2 %&gt;% drop_na(Greek) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Year=as_factor(Year))%&gt;%\n  filter(Gender== \"M\",\n         Year == 1 | Year == 2) %&gt;%\n   group_by(Term, Greek, Year) %&gt;%\n  summarise(ncount = n()) %&gt;%\n  ungroup() %&gt;%\n  group_by(Term, Year) %&gt;%\n  mutate(total = sum(ncount)) %&gt;% \n  ungroup() %&gt;%\n  mutate(propGreek = (ncount/total)*100) %&gt;%\n  filter(Greek == \"Planning\") %&gt;%\n    mutate(Year = factor(Year, levels = c(\"1\", \"2\"), \n              labels = c(\"Freshman\", \"Sophmore\")))\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'Term', 'Greek'. You can override using the\n`.groups` argument.\n\n\nNext I looked to see where all those males were coming from. Both freshman and sophmores males have been increasing in perctage planning on joining greek life, however, in the past few semesters there has been a jump in sophmore males; especially that last spring semester I spoke about in my introduction.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo investigate Sophmore males planning on joining greek further I ploted them individually with standard error bars and colored by weather it was pre or post pandemic. Last spring was by far the highest percentage of Sophmore males planning on joining greek, my hypothesis for this is that there was a need to affiliate for social reasons in that pandemic semester, and many of the people that would’ve rushed in the fall were not on campus. My hypothesis for why fall of 202 was so low is that people had been away from campus for so long that they felt like they needed to get their barrings and didnt know hat to expect socially.\n\n\n\n\n\nFinnally I compared the proportion of male sophmores planning to join a Fraternity in the semesters leading up with the proportion post pandemic and found that there was a difference in means at the 0.05938 signifcance level.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo Sample t-test: propGreek by postPandemic (continued below)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest statistic\ndf\nP value\nAlternative hypothesis\n\n\n\n\n1.983\n23\n0.05938\ntwo.sided\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmean in group Postpandemic\nmean in group Pretpandemic\n\n\n\n\n20.07\n11.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWrap-up\nIn conclusion, there has been a consistant increase in the percentage of males planning or in greek life, in fact these past two semesters were the first time that percentage was higher than the percentage of females. The second semester post pandemic saw a large uptick in the number of sophmore males planning on joing greek, I hypothesize this is because the limited social life on campus created pressure to socially affiliate. For sophmore males there was an increase in planning on joing greek at the 0.059 signifcance level. In the future I hope to revisit this data to see if this was just a blip."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Look at box office, ratings, votes, etc. and compare with google trends for oscars search\n\nIntroduction\nOver the last 30 years it seems that the movie that wins best picture at the Oscars has gotten more “artsy” and less “popular”. To investigate this question I will be using data pulled from the IMDB website, specifically the variables that count the number of ratings votes, the average rating, and the run time of movies for best picture winning movies over the last 30 years.\nIt is important to note that the last two best picture winners, “CODA” and “Nomadland” were not included in the data set as well as the 1996 film “The English Patient”\n\n\nAnalysis\nFigure 1 below shows a consistent decline in the number of votes the best picture received on IMDB by year. For each one year increase, the number of votes received by the best picture winner decreases by an estimated 21826 (p-value 0.027). This shows a steady decline in the popularity of the best picture winning movie.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nEstimate\nStd.

For each one year increase the average rating of the movie is estimated to decrease by 0.02 points. However the data points for this analysis are quite spread out and the p-value of that estimate is 0.0616 putting it above the .05 significance level.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nEstimate\nStd.

To analyze this I looked at IMDB data of the Oscar winners of the last 30 years and made multiple plots to visualize trends looking at number of votes and average rating. The results from the graphs of number of votes and average ratings showed a decline in both the number of people seeing the Oscar nominated movie over recent years and how much they liked the movie. Hopefully the Academy can change its ways and award films more popular among everyday people the best picture award and we can get more films like “Forrest Gump”.\n\n\nReferences\nhttps://www.imdb.com/search/title/?count=100&groups=oscar_best_picture_winners&sort=year%2Cdesc"

Over that time it aired 235 episodes with an average IMDB episode rating of 8.33. These two sitcoms have many similarities primarily that they are both about adults in their 20’s living in New York City.\n\n\nAnalysis\nFigure one shows the average episode rating by season, “Friends” shows fairly steady ratings by season with season 5 and 10 (the final season) being the highest just under a rating of 8.5. “How I Met Your Mother” shows a consistent decline in ratings, with season 9 (the final season) having the lowest average rating.
