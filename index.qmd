  Hi there ðŸ‘‹! I am a student at St. Lawrence University in Canton, NY currently pursuing a major in data science with a minor in film & representation studies. At St. Lawrence, I am a member of the Men's Tennis Team and a part of a living and learning theme community on campus.

  In my free time, I like to play backgammon, watch movies, and cheer for the Celtics.
