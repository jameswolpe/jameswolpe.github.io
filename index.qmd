  Hi there ðŸ‘‹! I am a student at St. Lawrence University in Canton, NY currently pursuing a major in data science with a minor in film & representation studies. At St. Lawrence, I am a member of the Men's Tennis Team and a part of a living and learning theme community on campus. In my free time, I like to play backgammon, watch movies, and cheer for the Celtics.

Under the guidance of the Principal Data Scientist and the Senior Director of Business Intelligence, I played a pivotal role in developing business intelligence (BI) solutions, fostering data-driven decision-making. Additionally, I engineered a predictive machine learning model in Python utilizing XGBoost, leading to a remarkable 4.5x increase in conversion rates for the top 20% of leads. My responsibilities also involved synthesizing data from a warehouse using SQL, conducting extensive exploratory data analysis, and implementing feature engineering to identify key attributes for lead conversion among a vast pool of over 300 features.

  `Summer 2023`
  
I spearheaded a Go-to-Market (GTM) analysis, comparing a novel AI product with its traditional human-operated counterpart. Leveraging the insights gained, I defined key performance indicators (KPIs) crucial for decision-making. Additionally, I developed and maintained data-driven dashboards using Google Looker. In weekly meetings, I effectively communicated insights and updates from the analysis, ensuring clear understanding among both technical and non-technical stakeholders about the strategic implications of our findings.
